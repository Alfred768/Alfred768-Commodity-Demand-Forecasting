Conducted research on commodity demand forecasting using advanced machine learning techniques:
•	Analyzed actual product sales data in depth to predict future demand over a three-month period.
•	Implemented the time-sliding window technique for data processing, devising inventive strategies for feature engineering.
•	Engineered and fine-tuned prediction models such as Prophet and Light-GBM in the code named "demo", systematically evaluating and comparing their performance. Identified the Prophet algorithm as the standout performer, showcasing superior accuracy among single models.
•	Applied an innovative fusion methodology, calculating an optimal coefficient through reciprocal error analysis. This led to the development of the highly effective LightGBM-Prophet fusion model for demand prediction in the code named "main".
The output is the list named "ensemble" in excel.
